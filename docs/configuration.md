# Configuration

Projects that wish to customize the [default configuration](/.puprc-defaults) can do so by adding a `.puprc` file to the
root of the project. This file is a JSON file that contains the configuration options that you wish to override.

### `paths.versions`

The regular expressions used to locate version numbers must have two capture groups. The first capture group is the _thing_
you are looking for that immediately prefixes the version number. The second capture group is the version number itself.

Here are some examples:

* [A file with the version number in a docblock](#example-a-file-with-the-version-number-in-a-docblock)
* [A file with the version number in a PHP define](#example-a-file-with-the-version-number-in-a-php-define)
* [A file with the version number in a constant](#example-a-file-with-the-version-number-in-a-constant)

#### Example: a file with the version number in a docblock

Let's say you have a WordPress `readme.txt` file that looks like this:

```text
=== My Plugin ===

Contributors: abunchofpeople
Tags: example
Requires at least: 5.8.6
Stable tag: 1.0.0
Tested up to: 6.2.2
Requires PHP: 7.4
License: GPLv2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

# etc...
```

This is what you should add as a `paths.versions` entry:

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "versions": [
            {
                "file": "readme.txt",
                "regex": "^(Stable tag: +)(.+)"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Example: a file with the version number in a PHP define

Let's say you have a bootstrap file called `bootstrap.php` in the root of your project that looks like this:

```php
<?php
// A bunch of stuff

define( 'MY_PLUGIN_VERSION', '1.0.0' );

// A bunch more stuff
```

This is what you should add as a `paths.versions` entry:

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "versions": [
            {
                "file": "bootstrap.php",
                "regex": "(define\\( +['\"]MY_PLUGIN_VERSION['\"], +['\"])([^'\"]+)"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Example: a file with the version number in a constant

Let's say you have the following class file: `src/MyPlugin/Plugin.php` that looks like this:

```php
<?php
namespace MyPlugin;

class Plugin {
    // A bunch of stuff
    
    /**
     * The version of the plugin.
     * @var string 
     */
    const VERSION = '1.0.0';

    // A bunch of stuff
}
```

This is what you should add as a `paths.versions` entry:

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "versions": [
            {
                "file": "src/MyPlugin/Plugin.php",
                "regex": "(const +VERSION += +['\"])([^'\"]+)"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
